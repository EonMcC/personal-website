        <p>What can I say about <strong>CodeClan</strong>? It changed my life and set me on a trajectory I never thought possible.</p>
        <p>I learned so much in such a short space of time and gained a career that I can be proud of.</p>
        <p>I completed three main projects, mastered a host of languages and skills, and participated in a post-graduation charity project. These are just some of the valuable experiences I took away from my time there.</p>
        <p>I was saddened to hear that CodeClan is no more — it was a great benefit to the Scottish tech scene.</p>
